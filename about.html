<h1>  ABOUT OUR RESTAURANT</h1>

<p>
At Shepherds inn restaurant, we’re serving up more than quality food. In fact,we are Famous for  our african recipe which is one of our unexpected specialties. Reminiscent of butcher shops back in the day, each slow-smoked, sizzling prime chop measures seven-fingers high.</p>
<p>Our signature recipe, that we have perfected for more than four decades, is rubbed with a secret blend of seasonings, cured and roasted on a rotisserie with pecan wood for up to six hours before it’s topped with herb-garlic butter then carved tableside.
